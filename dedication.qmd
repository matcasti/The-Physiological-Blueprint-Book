# Dedication {.unnumbered}

To my family and friends, whose unwavering support, patience, and belief in me provided the foundation for this work.

And to my colleagues and mentors, whose way to view the world and ask questions, shared passion for scientific discovery, and collaborative spirit continue to inspire my research and shape my understanding of the physiological world.
