**To achieve the 300-350 page count, we will need to adjust the depth of coverage for each topic.** The suggested page ranges for each part and chapter are estimates and can be modified based on how much detail we provide in the explanations, the number and complexity of R examples, and the inclusion of figures and exercises. Remember to keep the language accessible and focus on building intuition and practical skills for your target audience.
